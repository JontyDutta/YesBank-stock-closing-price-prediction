# **Project Summary -**

Yes Bank is a banking company that was founded in 2004 that offers a wide range of differentiated products for its corporate and retail customers through retail banking and asset management services. It is also a publically traded company. That provides an opportunity for anyone to invest in Yes bank and become a shareholder. But at the same time, it means that the valuation of the company is now in the hands of investors and speculators as share prices are often heavily impacted by public opinion. We have used yes bank stock price data set. This dataset contains 5 different features that can be used for predicting close price prediction using machine learning. We have built machine learning regression model for price prediction. We have used some of best models.
